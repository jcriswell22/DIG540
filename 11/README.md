**Assignment**

All parts of the assignment are discussed in the intro video above.

Part 1: Refamiliarize yourself with Scalar
- It can be confusing to know where you are in a Scalar book, so refamiliarize yourself with where you are and how to log in;

Part 2: Structured Media Gallery
- Edit the home page and make it a tag, by tagging your media-pages;
- Change the page to the Structured Media Gallery Layout;

Part 3: Timeline
- Add temporal metadata (dcterms:date) to each media-page in your Scalar book;
- Create a new page and tag each of your media;
- Set the new page to the Timeline Layout and watch as a TimelineJS timeline appears on the page!

Part 4: Write about plugins
- Write a blurb to Slack's #about-plugins channel where you reflect on the advantages, but also the disadvantages, of interactive plugins such as the TimelineJS widget (Scalar) or the Maps widget (in Omeka-S) and others that you might have worked with.

**The assignment should be done by Wednesday Nov. 16th.**
